## 🧭 Overview

This project is a comprehensive **Tufte Case Study Report** that critiques real-world data visualizations using **Edward Tufte’s five core principles**:

- 📏 **Graphical Integrity**
- ✍️ **Data Ink Ratio**
- 🚫 **Chartjunk**
- 📊 **Data Density**
- 🧩 **Small Multiples**

By dissecting and comparing **4 different types of charts**, the report demonstrates how visualizations can mislead or clarify depending on their design.

<summary><strong>1. CpG Island Hypermethylation – 3D Bar Chart</strong> 📊</summary>

**🎯 Problem:**  
The use of a 3D bar chart introduces visual distortion. Perspective and shadows make some bars appear taller or shorter than they really are, reducing the integrity of the data.

**✅ Better Approach:**  
Switch to a clean 2D bar chart. This preserves the clarity of comparisons while removing distracting aesthetics. Focus on honest representation, not decoration.

<summary><strong>2. Overlapping Pie Chart (178%)</strong> 🥧</summary>

**⚠️ Problem:**  
This pie chart misleads by totaling 178% — a conceptual failure, since pie charts should represent parts of a whole. It fails to handle overlapping categories properly.

**✅ Better Approach:**  
Use a Venn diagram or grouped bar chart to show category overlap without inflating total values. This ensures logical accuracy and viewer trust.

<summary><strong>3. COVID-19 Death Spiral Chart</strong> 🌀</summary>

**📉 Problem:**  
The spiral format is visually eye-catching but analytically confusing. Overlapping lines and nonlinear scales make trends hard to follow or compare.

**✅ Better Approach:**  
Separate country data into small multiples (side-by-side mini line charts). This allows better cross-country comparison and highlights trends over time more effectively.

<summary><strong>4. Employment Trends with Dots</strong> 🔘</summary>

**🔍 Problem:**  
The dot-based design suffers from inconsistent marker sizing and color gradients that obscure the actual values. It sacrifices accuracy for aesthetics.

**✅ Better Approach:**  
Replace with consistent-sized scatter plots or line graphs using minimal styling. Keep it simple to help the audience stay focused on the actual job trend shifts.
