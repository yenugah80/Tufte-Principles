## 🧭 Overview

This project is a comprehensive **Tufte Case Study Report** that critiques real-world data visualizations using **Edward Tufte’s five core principles**:

- 📏 **Graphical Integrity**
- ✍️ **Data Ink Ratio**
- 🚫 **Chartjunk**
- 📊 **Data Density**
- 🧩 **Small Multiples**

By dissecting and comparing **4 different types of charts**, the report demonstrates how visualizations can mislead or clarify depending on their design.   

   📌 Evaluated Graphs

    1. **CpG Island Hypermethylation – 3D Bar Chart**
📉 _Issue: Distorted data through unnecessary 3D rendering_  
✅ **Recommendation**: Use 2D bar charts to ensure integrity and reduce visual noise.

   

    2. **Overlapping Pie Chart (178%)**
🥧 _Issue: Misleading percentages & poor category distinction_  
✅ **Recommendation**: Replace with Venn diagrams or stacked bar charts to reflect overlaps accurately.

   

    3. **COVID 19 Death Spiral Chart**
🌪️ _Issue: Spiral format distorts trend visibility and comparative clarity_  
✅ **Recommendation**: Use line charts and small multiples for trend clarity.

   

    4. **Employment Trends with Dots**
⚪ _Issue: Inconsistent dot sizes and gradients hide numeric clarity_  
✅ **Recommendation**: Use scatter plots or consistent line graphs with minimalistic design.

   

   🔍 Key Takeaways

✔️ Tufte’s principles help maintain data honesty and reader trust  
✔️ Over decorated charts harm comprehension  
✔️ Simpler, clearer designs improve insight and usability  
✔️ Small multiples enable better comparison
